Description:
libyuv is an open source project that includes YUV conversion and scaling
functionality.

The optimized scaler in libyuv is used in multiple resolution encoder example,
which down-samples the original input video (f.g. 1280x720) a number of times
in order to encode multiple resolution bit streams.
